# MixedModelsSmallSample

The confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the fixed effects in
[MixedModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/stable/)
are based on large sample approximations.
This package implements small sample corrections for these intervals and tests, as described in:

> Kenward, Michael G., and James H. Roger. "Small sample inference for fixed effects from restricted maximum likelihood." Biometrics (1997): 983-997,

and in:

> Hrong-Tai Fai, Alex, and Paul L. Cornelius. "Approximate F-tests of multiple degree of freedom hypotheses in generalized least squares analyses of unbalanced split-plot experiments." Journal of statistical computation and simulation 54.4 (1996): 363-378.

## Getting Started

We will look at a split plot experiment, described in chapter 10 of:

> Goos, Peter, and Bradley Jones. Optimal design of experiments: a case study approach. John Wiley & Sons, 2011.

Split-plot experiments have hard-to-change factors and easy-to-change factors.
Hard-to-change factors are not properly randomized,
they are kept at the same factor setting for multiple observations.
The dataset can thus be split up into blocks, where the hard-to-change factors remain constant.
These blocks are also called whole plots.
The observations within such a block are more similar to one another than observations coming from a different block.
A random intercept per block is introduced to deal with the correlation between observations.
In the below dataset, FRH and RRH are hard-to-change, while YA and GC are easy-to-change.
The WP column shows that there are 10 blocks in the dataset in which FRH and RRH remain constant.
Efficiency is the output we want to model.

We work with a full quadratic model, where the intercept is allowed to vary between blocks.
First, we get the output using only `MixedModels`.
Here, the p-values for the main effects (first-order terms) are all below `1e-10`.

```@example split_plot
using MixedModels
fm = @formula(
    EFFICIENCY ~
        1 +
        (1 | WP) +
        FRH +
        RRH +
        YA +
        GC +
        FRH & RRH +
        FRH & YA +
        FRH & GC +
        RRH & YA +
        RRH & GC +
        YA & GC +
        FRH & FRH +
        RRH & RRH +
        YA & YA +
        GC & GC
)
m = fit(MixedModel, fm, df; REML=true)
```

Now we look at the adjustments made in the Kenward Roger approach.
The p-values for the main effects of the hard-to-change factors are much larger.
This is primarily because the degrees of freedom for these factors are very limited.

Similar results hold for the second-order terms.
Terms involving only the hard-to-change factors have limited degrees of freedom.
The interactions involving both a hard and an easy-to-change factor
have similar degrees of freedom as terms only involving easy-to-change factors.

```@example split_plot
using MixedModelsSmallSample
kr = adjust_KR(m; FIM_σ²=:expected)
```

The standard errors on the estimates are also slightly different.
However, for this specific experiment, the adjustment does not have a large effect.
An example where there is a large difference in standard error will be added later.

## Multiple random effects

```@example slope
using CSV
using DataFrames
using MixedModels

using MixedModelsSmallSample

df = DataFrame(MixedModels.dataset(:sleepstudy))
fm = @formula(reaction ~ 1 + days + zerocorr(1 + days | subj)) # zerocorr is necessary
m = fit(MixedModel, fm, df; REML=true)
```

```@example slope
kr = adjust_KR(m; FIM_σ²=:expected) # :expected or :observed
```

## Mathematical details

To quantify the uncertainty on the estimates of the variance components,
either the observed or the expected Fisher information matrix can be used,
by passing `:expected` or `:observed` to the keyword argument `FIM_σ²`.
Observed is the default option.

## Limitations

Currently, correlated random effects are not supported.
In the above example the `zerocorr` is necessary.
